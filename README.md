# cv_single_page_app

## Introduction
So, this is a learning-by-doing exercise
I have been messing abot with static websites and what I have found is that I understand while I am doing the course but forget instantly afterwards.
I thought it would be fun to create a CV static website to practice what I am learning as I go  alon.

## Method
I am committing to gitHub as I go a long in small inremente=s as I am doing this while working fulltime, looking after 2 childern (still at home) and caing for my father after a fall *(his, not mine)*.
The odds of me forgetting where I am are HUGE!
